# loxone-klf200-control

_This project is work in progress_.

This project provides a wrapper around the TCP-based Velux KLF-200 API and exposes basic functionality to control
products via dedicated http endpoints.
Those http endpoints can then be used inside the Loxone Config to integrate e.g. Velux roof lights into the system.
